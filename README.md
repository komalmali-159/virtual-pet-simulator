# Virtual Pet Simulator

## Overview
Virtual Pet Simulator is a web-based application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to interact with a virtual pet by feeding it, playing with it, and putting it to sleep.

The pet’s **hunger, happiness, and energy** change over time and are visually represented using progress bars.  
The pet also displays different states such as **happy, sad, idle, and sleeping** based on its condition.

This project was developed as part of an **internship and web development practice**.
